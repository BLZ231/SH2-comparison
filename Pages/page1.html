            <p>While the original's visuals are clearly dated, they fit the 
            dreary otherworldly feeling of Silent Hill. The problem with 
            the remake's visuals is that it's clearly trying to show off 
            just how advanced modern graphics can be, but forgets that most 
            of the game wasn't supposed to look pretty in the first place.

        <div class="item-1c">
            <p>The original had drab and washed out colors and environments 
            that looked decayed and abandoned. Not only did this suit the 
            unnerving tone of the game, it also made it easier to pick out 
            the details and items that were important, as these elements were 
            visually distinct. In the remake though the colors aren't as 
            washed out, and the environments are much more cluttered. This 
            not only undermines the tone, but it causes the important details 
            and items to get lost in the visual noise, necessitating the 
            clumsy use of icons and markers to make up for the game's 
            undisciplined art direction.

            <p>The monsters also don't feel quite as viscerally grotesque 
            and horrifying as they were in the original in terms of how 
            they look, move, and sound. The designs in the original found 
            a good balance between the mundane and the nightmarish, making 
            the monsters feel disturbingly real.

        </div>
        <div class="item-1f">
            <p>The remake on the other hand focused less on making the 
            monsters feel real and more on making the monsters scary, which 
            largely fell flat. In general the original monster designs 
            looked and felt like actual inhuman monsters, while the new 
            monster designs look more like people in costumes cosplaying 
            as monsters. Extremely good costumes in fairness, but costumes 
            nonetheless.
