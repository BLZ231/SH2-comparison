    {Heading: Visuals}

    {Paragraph 1}
        {While the original’s visuals are clearly dated, they fit the dreary 
        otherworldly feeling of Silent Hill. The problem with the remake’s 
        visuals is that it’s clearly trying to show off just how advanced 
        modern graphics can be, but forgets that most of the game wasn’t 
        supposed to look pretty in the first place.}

    {Paragraph 2}
        {The original had drab and washed out colors and environments that 
        looked decayed and abandoned. Not only did this suit the unnerving 
        tone of the game, it also made it easier to pick out the details 
        and items that were important, as these elements were visually 
        distinct. In the remake though the colors aren’t as washed out, 
        and the environments are much more cluttered. This not only undermines 
        the tone, but it causes the important details and items to get lost in 
        the visual noise, necessitating the clumsy use of icons and markers to 
        make up for the game’s undisciplined art direction.}

    {Paragraph 3}
        {The monsters also don’t feel quite as viscerally grotesque and 
        horrifying as they were in the original in terms of how they look, move, 
        and sound. The designs in the original found a good balance between the 
        mundane and the nightmarish, making the monsters feel disturbingly real.}

    {Paragraph 4}
        {The remake on the other hand focused less on making the monsters 
        feel real and more on making the monsters scary, which largely fell 
        flat. In general the original monster designs looked and felt like 
        actual inhuman monsters, while the new monster designs look more like 
        people in costumes cosplaying as monsters. Extremely good costumes in 
        fairness, but costumes nonetheless.}

    <!--Originally I had a section comparing the character designs, but the
    points I wanted to make really require someone to see the respective
    characters move and gesture, and still images don't really convey
    the problems with the new designs. So I scrapped it. Oh well.-->
