            <p>By far the biggest problem with the remake is the narrative 
            pacing. <br> Every section in the original was only as long as it 
            needed to be and then it moved on to the next section, <br> and once 
            the narrative journey was over it ended right when it was 
            supposed to. <br> It felt like the perfect length, not feeling too 
            short, but also not overstaying its welcome, it was just right. <br> 
            It's not an easy balance to find, which is one of many things 
            that makes the original so remarkable.

            <p>In contrast the remake's journey is about twice as long as 
            the original's despite telling essentially the same story. <br> This 
            naturally results in lots of pacing issues, as almost every 
            section of the game feels padded out and overstays its welcome, <br> 
            which makes getting through the game feel like a slog. Even 
            sections that are a nice addition or even an improvement over 
            the original <br> are ruined because they last too long and become 
            a chore to get through.
