    {Paragraph 1}
        {The original, like the first Silent Hill, had a masterful 
        atmosphere, in large part because it knew how to be subtle, and 
        had the confidence to let its horror set pieces speak for 
        themselves, and allowed the player’s imagination and fear to do a 
        lot of the work. The remake unfortunately doesn’t quite understand 
        subtlety, and instead of being confident in itself it feels the 
        need to be overtly and blatant scary, which ends up having the 
        opposite effect. Less is more, and because fear is inherently 
        subjective it’s better to focus on cultivating an effective 
        atmosphere than actively trying to be scary, because trying to be 
        scary and failing can end up making you look very silly and/or 
        annoying.}
