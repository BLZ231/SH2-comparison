            <p>The original, like the first Silent Hill, had a masterful 
            atmosphere, in large part because it knew how to be subtle, <br> 
            and had the confidence to let its horror set pieces speak for 
            themselves, <br> allowing the player's imagination and fear to do 
            a lot of the work. <br><br> The remake unfortunately doesn't quite 
            understand subtlety, <br> and instead of being confident in itself 
            it feels the need to be overtly and blatant scary, <br> which ends 
            up having the opposite effect. Less is more, and because fear 
            is inherently subjective <br> it's better to focus on cultivating an 
            effective atmosphere than actively trying to be scary, <br> because 
            trying to be scary and failing can end up making you look very 
            silly and/or annoying.
