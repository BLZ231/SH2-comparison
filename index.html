    {Intro Paragraph}
        {The Silent Hill 2 Remake exceeded expectations by actually 
        being pretty good, which considering Konami’s track record 
        is a damn miracle. But while it’s a good game, and you can 
        tell that the developers were trying, it doesn’t quite capture 
        what made the original so compelling, and there are numerous 
        areas where it falls flat.}
